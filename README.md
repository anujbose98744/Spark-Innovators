# Spark-Innovators
Repository for my first project — includes source code, experiments, and documentation developed as part of Spark Innovators.


# 🌟 Spark Innovators

Welcome to **Spark Innovators** — my first project repository!  
This repo contains all my beginner-to-intermediate level codes and experiments involving **Raspberry Pi**, **ESP32**, and IoT-based applications.

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Spark Innovators** is a collection of small projects that combine embedded systems, Python programming, and IoT.  
The main goal is to connect devices like **ESP32** and **Raspberry Pi** over Wi-Fi to perform tasks such as controlling LEDs, reading sensors, and hosting simple web servers.

## 🧩 Features
- Code for **Raspberry Pi** automation and hardware control  
- **ESP32 web server** and Wi-Fi communication examples  
- **MQTT** and IoT connectivity between Pi and ESP32  
- Sensor data collection and LED control examples  
- Step-by-step comments and easy explanations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3** (for Raspberry Pi scripts)  
- **C/C++** (for ESP32, via PlatformIO or Arduino IDE)  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** (for web interfaces)  
- **MQTT Protocol** (for IoT communication)  
- **VS Code + PlatformIO / Thonny**
